    "Your results so far should allow you to conclude that the neural network is quite effective in learning to distinguish sequences that bind the protein from sequences that do not. But can we understand _why_ the neural network classifies a training point in the way that it does? To do so, we can compute a simple _saliency map_, which is the gradient of the model's prediction with respect to each individual nucleotide. \n",

    "In other words, the saliency maps shows how the output response value changes with respect to a small changes in input nucleotide sequence. All the positive values in the gradients tell us that a small change to that nucleotide will change the output value. Hence, visualizing these gradients for a given input sequence, should provide some clues about what nucleotides form the binding motive that we are trying to identify."

If you recall from the top of the document, this is exactly the motif that we embedded in the positive sequences! The raw saliency values may be non-zero for other bases as well -- the gradient-based saliency map method is not perfect, and there other more complex interpretation methods that are used in practice to obtain better results.  \n",

For example, we could choose different _hyper-parameters_, which are variables that define the network structure (e.g. the number of dense or convolutional layers, the dimensionality of each layer, etc.) and variables that determine how the network is trained (e.g. the number of epochs, the learning rate, etc.). Testing different hyper-parameter values or performing a hyper-parameter search grid are good practices that may help the deep learning procedure to obtain a clearer signal for classifying sequences and identifying the binding motif."
